Installation
============
Before installing all packages, we recommend installing pyenv and poetry as
a tool to manage your python versions and packages.

Python Version
--------------

We recommend using the 3.8.1 version of Python.

Dependencies
------------
These distributions will be installed automatically when installing the SnapBee
Figure Extraction via poetry. To do this, we can simply do
:code:`poetry install --no-interaction --no-ansi --no-dev --no-root` to just
get the dependencies needed for running the application.
